Hello. Welcome to my Flask Web Application. This Flask Application shows how you can easily
integrate a MySQL Database with your Flask Application along with creating a brand new web
application from scratch.

The main purpose of this project is to teach people who are new to Flask and Docker a little bit of
back-end developing.

This project is great for resumes and I highly encourage you to follow through this repository and
learn the basics of Docker, Flask, MySQL.

Best Regards!

Quan Nguyen
